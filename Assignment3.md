## Part 1:
```
Let S = it is sunny, C = camping is fun, H = the homework is
done, and M = mathematics is easy.
```  
 - [ ] Translate into English: (M → H)∧(S →C)
 
 
 - [ ] Translate into Propositional Logic: “Mathematics is easy or camping is fun, as long as it is sunny and the homework is done.”
 
 
 
## Part 2: 
 - [ ] Use a truth table to determine whether this is a tautology, contradiction, or neither:  (¬B → ¬A) → ((¬B → A) → B)
 
 
 - [ ] Use a truth table to determine whether this is a tautology, contradiction, or neither:  ((A → B)∧(B → ¬A)) → A
 
 
  
## Part 3:
```
For each of the following pairs of propositions, show that the
two propositions are logically equivalent by finding a chain of equivalences from one
to the other. State which definition or law of logic justifies each equivalence in the
chain.
```
 - [ ] (p ∧ q) → r , p → (q → r )
 
 
 - [ ] (q ∨r ) → p, (q → p)∧(r → p)
 
 
## Part 4:
```
Let Loves(x,y) mean “x loves y,” Traveler(x) mean “x is a traveler,”
City(x) mean “x is a city,” Lives(x,y) mean “x lives in y.”
```
 - [ ] Translate into English: ∃x∀y∀z(C i t y(x)∧Tr aveler (y)∧Li ves(z,x)) → (Loves(y,x)∧ ¬Loves(z,x))
 
 
 - [ ] Translate into Predicate Logic: “No traveler loves the city they live in.”
 
 
  
## Extra Credit:
```
Assuming: p → (q ∧r ), s → r , r → p
Prove: s → q.
```


```
Assuming: ¬(r ∨ s), ¬p → s, p → q. 
Prove: q
```
