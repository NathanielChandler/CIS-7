I'm going to preface this by saying that I am generally not a fan of video tutorials, so I opt out of using them if it is not required. 
However, I do think I made a mistake not checking out this content creator sooner. From my short exposure to him, the lessons he give are 
both easy to follow and rather on point, which address one of the issues I have with many video tutorials. I definitly hear similarities
between your teaching style and his, granted his are coming across at a higher pitch at 2x speed. Had I actually utilized the resource earlier,
the most helpful video would have to be the Rules of Inference. In the video, he does a good job at breaking down the foundations of
different logical outcomes. However, memorizing the vocabluary associated with each rule does requrie a couple of views, but that's more a 
result of the diction, with the exception of rules 5 - 7.
