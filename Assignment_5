## Part 1: (10 points)  

Prove each of the following.  Indicate which proof method you are using and show your work.

 - [ ]  Show that the square root of 2 is irrational.
        - The first proof would be that NASA has a webpage displaying the square root of two out to 1 million digits, but 
          that would be to easy
          No, seriously:  https://apod.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/sqrt2.1mil
        
        
 
 - [ ]  If n = 25, 100, or 169, then n is a perfect square and is the sum of two perfect squares.
        Direct Proof 
        - Assume n = 25
           - sqrt(25) = 5 : true
           - 25 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 : true
        - Assume n = 100
           - sqrt(100) = 10 : true
           - 100 = 6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 : true
        - Assume n = 169
           - sqrt(169) = 13 : true
           - 169 = 12^2 + 5^2 = 144 + 25 : true
        The statement above is true
 
 - [ ]  The sum of two odd integers is even.  
           - Hint: By definition, even integers can be expressed as 2n, thus odd integers can be expressed as 2n + 1	
           
 
 - [ ]  The sum of an even integer and it's square is even
 
 - [ ]  If n squared is odd, then n is odd
 

## Part 2: (10 points)
  
- [ ] Prove by induction that 1 + 5 + 9 + ... + (4n-3) = n(2n-1)

- [ ] Prove that for any positive integer number n, n^3 + 2n is divisible by 3		

- [ ] Prove that for n >= 1, 9^n âˆ’ 1 is divisible by 8 for all non-negative integers
		 - Hint: 4^(3+1) = 4 * 4^3
		 - Hint: If 9^n - 1 = 8m, then 9^n = 8m + 1
